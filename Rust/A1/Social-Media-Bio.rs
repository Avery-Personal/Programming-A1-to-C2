A1 - Social-Media Bio Program

This is a simple program, for Rust, that can get your input, and give you a generated bio/about me.

The program below will try to dumb things down as much as it can for beginners to understand, and not use any advanced functions.

// The io file, is the core library when coding in Rust, in this case, allowing you to create inputs.
use std::io;

// When creating your main script in Rust, it wont read it top to bottom like others might; Rust looks for a function called main, to know where to start actually running its file.

// For now, we won't use any functions besides main, to ease it as much as possible
fn main() {
    
}
